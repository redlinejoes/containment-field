## Definition

["A special forcefield that prevents a highly volatile power source, anti-matter engine core, captured Super-Entity, an orb of Pure Energy, etc., from obliterating everything around it in a flash of pure white."](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField)

The **primary function** is to securely design Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA) around software-defined infrastructure and the Platform as a Service (PaaS).

The **secondary function** provides the IDP with Container Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) as a Service and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for Desktop as a Service (DaaS).

### What is an Internal Developer Platform?

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a set of tools and technologies that an organization uses to manage the development and deployment of software applications.

Modern IDPs are often cloud-based and accessible through a web browser or dedicated client software. The IDP can also integrate with external tools and services, such as those provided by third-party vendors.

- #### What is the purpose of the IDP?

    The purpose of an IDP is to streamline and automate the software development process, making it more efficient and effective.

- #### What does the IDP include?

    An IDP typically includes tools for version control, issue tracking, project management, continuous integration and delivery, testing, and deployment. It may also have tools for collaboration and communication among developers, such as chat and video conferencing.

## Background

The Containment Field emerged as a research project while studying Enterprise Integration Patterns and The Software Architect Elevator by G. Hohpe. 

Research and development go into extending my network services to offer low-latency, high-fidelity streaming solutions over securely designed Zero Trust networks. 

It evolved out of the need to secure the low-latency infrastructure services to the level of the Zero Trust strategy, including security orchestration automation and response (SOAR).
