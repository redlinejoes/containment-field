## Definition

Science fiction defines a containment field as follows, ["A special forcefield that prevents a highly volatile power source, anti-matter engine core, captured Super-Entity, an orb of Pure Energy, etc., from obliterating everything around it in a flash of pure white."](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField)

In the context of cloud native computing, the Containment Field is a cybersecurity-hardened hyper-converged infrastructure as code (HCIaC) habitable Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

The **primary function** is to provide Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA) around software-defined infrastructure and the Platform as a Service (PaaS).

The **secondary function** provides the habitable Container Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) as a Service and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).

## Background

The Containment Field emerged to create a **user-friendly and adaptable environment for both developers and gamers**. It evolved by integrating infrastructure automation and software-defined resources to deliver a seamless experience, enabling efficient development and immersive gaming within a single, robust ecosystem.

### What is an Internal Developer Platform?

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a set of tools and technologies that an organization uses to manage the development and deployment of software applications.

Modern IDPs are often cloud-based and accessible through a web browser or dedicated client software. The IDP can also integrate with external tools and services, such as those provided by third-party vendors.

- #### What is the purpose of the IDP?

    The purpose of an IDP is to streamline and automate the software development process, making it more efficient and effective.

- #### What does the IDP include?

    An IDP typically includes tools for version control, issue tracking, project management, continuous integration and delivery, testing, and deployment. It may also have tools for collaboration and communication among developers, such as chat and video conferencing.
