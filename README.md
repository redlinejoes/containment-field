# Containment Field

## Definition

A special forcefield that prevents a highly volatile power source, anti-matter engine core, Captured Super-Entity, an orb of Pure Energy, etc., from obliterating everything around it in a flash of pure white. <https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField>

### Background

Modern particle accelerators are actually capable of concentrating destructive amounts of energy in their beams. A failure of the magnetic fields which steer the beam is a very real eventuality, and accelerator designers implement complex machine protection systems that rapidly react to those events in order to avoid damage to the expensive equipment. Simulations show that one beam from the European LHC, at full power, could punch through forty meters of solid copper in 86 microseconds. Similarly, the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (or RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab in New York contains redundant magnetic containment for its high-energy ion beams; it also needs gigantic thicknesses of solid marble and heavy metal (lead, iron, etc) to 'catch' the beam safely when it's dumped out of the accelerator ring. Both RHIC and the LHC also employ complex electronic and mechanical systems that essentially act as a mechanical 'containment field'.

Lead and other heavy metals don't work for a beam at the energies the LHC produces. They use a 10-ton rod of graphite and move the beam around so it doesn't melt it.

Fusion occurs at such high temperatures that, to contain the (generally isotopes of) hydrogen undergoing fusion, you use a magnetic field to keep that superheated fuel away from the walls of the reactor. Fusion reactors have been built and have been run, but the energy required to create, sustain, and contain the reaction has so far been greater than the energy it has been possible to generate (except for fusion bombs, which are obviously impractical for any application that doesn't involve Stuff Blowing Up).

Even smaller devices like fusors found in many colleges, which usually cannot produce net energy, require a massive amount of shielding. In these cases, though, it's less a matter of the released plasma or superheated fuel being an issue, and more a concern about releasing hard X-rays and fast neutrons bouncing around should the lead glass break.

However, said magnetic fields not only contain the reaction, they also create the high pressure environment needed for the reaction to occur. Unlike fission, which left to its own will cascade and must be controlled with, yes, control rods, fusion requires a precise environment in term of pressure and temperature. Should the fields fail, then the fusion reaction will simply cease. In other words, if you lose containment, you don't get a boom: the reactor shuts down. Radioactive byproducts of the reaction may still leak out though, depending on how the reactor is engineered. The plasma itself may not instantly cool down either and might pose a threat to nearby objects.

Inertial Containment Fusion uses lasers to initiate and contain a fusion reaction. The largest and most powerful lasers in the world, big as football fields, some of them rated in the Terawatt range, are required. Like Magnetic Containment Fusion, failure of the lasers just causes a failure of the fusion reaction, and the reactor shuts down rather than blow up spectacularly.

Antimatter also needs to be suspended in a magnetic field to prevent it from contacting matter and exploding. Which means that only individual subatomic particles of antimatter can be stored for any length of time, like a positively charged field would contain positrons (anti-electrons) but not anti-protons or neutral atoms of antimatter.

As mentioned in the intro above, modern Fission reactors typically feature the containment rods being held up by electromagnets. In the event of an emergency, the electromagnets fail and the control rods drop into the reactor to shut it down. In this scenario, the Containment Field actually contains the safety device rather than the potentially dangerous reaction. Such an arrangement is but one example of a "Fail-Safe" design.
