# Definition

["A special forcefield that prevents a highly volatile power source, anti-matter engine core, captured Super-Entity, an orb of Pure Energy, etc., from obliterating everything around it in a flash of pure white."](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField)

### Primary Function

This repository is a collection of FOSS resources combined to securely design open-source Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA) around software-defined infrastructure and the IDP Platform as a Service (PaaS) user experience (UX).

### Secondary Function

Provide the IDP with Container Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) as a Service and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for Desktop as a Service (DaaS).

## What is an Internal Developer Platform?

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a set of tools organizations use to manage software development resources. IDPs are often cloud-based and accessed through a web browser or client software. They can also integrate with external tools and services provided by third-party vendors.

- ### What is the purpose of the IDP?

    A well-architected IDP brings value by reducing the cognitive load on developers. Its purpose is to streamline and automate the software development process, making it more efficient and effective.

- ### What does the IDP include?

    An IDP typically includes tools for version control, issue tracking, project management, continuous integration and delivery, testing, and deployment. It may also have tools for collaboration and communication among developers, such as chat and video conferencing.

# Background

The Containment Field emerged as a research project while studying Enterprise Integration Patterns and The Software Architect Elevator by G. Hohpe. 

Research and development go into extending my network services to offer low-latency, high-fidelity streaming solutions over securely designed Zero Trust networks. 

It evolved out of the need to secure the low-latency infrastructure services to the level of the Zero Trust strategy, including security orchestration automation and response (SOAR).
