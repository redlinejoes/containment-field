# This boilerplate includes the basic components of a Helm chart

The Chart.yaml file contains metadata about the chart, such as its name, description, version, and application version.
The values.yaml file contains default values for configurable parameters. In this example, we've defined the number of replicas, the Docker image to use, and the service type and port.
The templates directory contains Kubernetes YAML files that describe the resources that Helm will create. In this example, we've included a Deployment YAML file and a Service YAML file, which will create a Deployment and a Service for an Nginx web server.
The NOTES.txt file contains instructions that will be displayed after the chart is installed. In this example, we've included instructions for accessing the application URL
