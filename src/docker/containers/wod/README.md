## About

Windows inside a Docker container.

### Use Cases

When you need Windows, but you only need it for a short time. Or when you want to keep a Windows installation, but you don't want to dedicate an entire physical system to the operating system. 

With Windows inside a Docker container it is possible to run full Windows applications in a sandbox environment using Zero Trust principles. 

The network configuration supports IPv4, IPv6, static or dynamic address assignment, Docker IPVLAN, Docker MACVLAN, and may other options for Zero Trust micro- and nano-segmentation solutions. 

The display configuration supports GPU assignment through the Docker NVIDIA runtime service. 

Audio and microphone passthrough are supported.
